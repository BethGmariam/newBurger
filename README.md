# Eat-Da-Burger:

A restaurant app that lets user input the name of the burger they'd like to eat.
As user submits the burger name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the 
right side of the page indicating it is devoured. 
 
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. https://mysqlburger.herokuapp.com/
